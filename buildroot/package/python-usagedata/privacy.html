usageData
<h2>Anonymous usage data</h2>
<p>When enabled, the system will submit anonymized usage data to
a HiFiBerry server. This helps us to understand what features are used. 
Without these data it is not possible for us to spend our development
efforts on the right features. We might even remove some features
if we think that nobody is using them.</p>
<h2>What's shared?</h2>
<p>Anonymous usage about what features and sources are used, no data about the music you're listening.</p>
<p>You can have a look at these data by yourself by logging in and running <pre>/opt/hifiberry/bin/report-dump</pre>.</p>
