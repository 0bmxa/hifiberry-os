# Feature requests

## Posting feature requests
We know that HiFiBerryOS users have a lot of ideas what could be improved. You can post feature request here:
https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os/issues

## How we handle feature requests
The fact that we accepted a feature request doesn't mean we will implement this. We will do some internal priorisation of 
features request into priorities high/medium/low. We also have our internal backlog that isn't public. If this is empty, 
we might work on feature requests based on the priority.

This mean, if your feature request has a low priority for us, there isn't really a good chance that this will be implemented 
soon. Feature requests might also be re-prioritised from time to time.

## What can you do to get things done faster

You might not agree with our internal priorities - we can understand this. There is one way to speed this up: contribute! 
HiFiBerryOS is open source and the more other developers contribute to it the better it will be. Check out our 
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Stuff we won't integrate

We might decide that some features won't be included at all. Reasons for this might be that it will add lots of complexity 
for the system, have negative impact on existing functionalities or or just hard to understand for the user.
