# HiFiBerryOS

HiFiBerryOS is our version of a minimal Linux distribution optimized for audio playback. 
The goal isn't to add as much functionality as possible, but to keep it small. Therefore, 
it is based on Buildroot and it's not possible to use package managers to add more 
software.

Also, there is no update mechanism included at the moment.
